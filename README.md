# My First HTML Project

This repository contains my very first HTML project on GitHub. The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with creating and managing a project in Git, while also learning basic HTML, CSS, and Git commands. This project represents my first steps in web development, and it has helped me understand how to organize and work with files in a version-controlled environment.

## Folder Structure

- **/index.html**: The main HTML file for the project, containing the basic structure of the webpage.
- **/styles**: A directory that includes the CSS files for styling the webpage. This helps keep the styles organized and separated from the HTML structure.
- **/images**: A folder for storing images used in the project. It keeps all media assets organized.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project and the key learning outcomes from my first Git and HTML experience.

## Project Overview

This is a simple webpage I created to practice my HTML and CSS skills. It features:
- Basic webpage structure using HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<div>`, `<section>`, etc.
- Use of inline and external CSS for styling the webpage.
- A responsive layout, adapting to various screen sizes.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the process of developing this project, I learned both the basics of HTML and CSS as well as how to effectively use Git for version control. Below are the key learning outcomes from this project:

### 1. **Learning HTML Basics**
   - I started by learning the fundamental building blocks of web development: HTML tags, attributes, and how to structure a webpage. I built the basic structure using elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
   - Example: I created the `<header>` element to contain the website's title and a simple navigation bar.

### 2. **CSS Styling**
   - I used CSS to style the webpage, applying styles to elements like fonts, colors, margins, padding, and layout.
   - Example: I created a `styles/style.css` file to separate the CSS from the HTML, keeping the project organized. I used the `background-color` property to set the background color of the page and adjusted the text size with `font-size`.

### 3. **Git Version Control**
   - This was my first time using Git to track changes in a project, and I learned essential Git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`.
   - Example: After modifying `index.html` and adding a new feature, I staged the changes using `git add .` and then committed them with a message like `git commit -m "Added navigation bar to index.html"`.

### 4. **Creating and Pushing to a GitHub Repository**
   - I created my first GitHub repository to host the project and pushed my local project to GitHub. I learned how to set up the repository and connect my local project to the remote one using `git remote add origin` and `git push`.
   - Example: After completing the HTML structure, I pushed the project to GitHub with `git push -u origin main`, making it available online for public access.

### 5. **Using Git Branches for Experimentation**
   - I learned how to create branches to work on different features or changes without affecting the main project.
   - Example: I created a new branch called `feature-header` to experiment with modifying the page header without affecting the main branch. After finalizing the changes, I merged the branch back into the `main` branch using `git merge feature-header`.

### 6. **Learning to Track and Review Changes**
   - I learned how to track the history of my changes using the `git log` command, which shows the commit history of the project.
   - Example: Running `git log` allowed me to see a list of all the changes I made, including the commit messages, which helped me stay organized throughout the project.

### 7. **Collaborating with GitHub**
   - Even though this was a solo project, I learned the basics of collaboration using GitHub. I understood how other developers can contribute to the project by cloning the repository and submitting pull requests.
   - Example: I created a public repository, which will allow others to fork it and contribute to it in the future.

### 8. **Responsive Web Design**
   - In this project, I explored how to make the website responsive, meaning it adjusts its layout based on the screen size (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop). I used CSS media queries to achieve this.
   - Example: I added a media query in `style.css` to make the navigation bar stack vertically on smaller screens instead of horizontally.

---

By completing this project, I gained a solid understanding of basic HTML and CSS, as well as the essential Git commands required to manage a project effectively. This project helped me learn how to work with version control using Git and GitHub, and how to organize a project with a clear structure.
